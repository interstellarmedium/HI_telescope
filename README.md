# HI_telescope

Documentation for building and running a simple horn radio telescope
for detecting the HI 21cm line. This has been tested through a
summer high school program and as a graduate seminar.
It is a fun one-semester group project that combines hardware and software.
The associated python notebooks show how to analyze the data,
determine radial motions, and measure the rotation
curve of the Milky Way.
