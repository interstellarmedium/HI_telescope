# HI_telescope

Here is documentation for building a simple horn radio telescope
for detecting the HI 21cm line. This has been tested through a
summer high school program and as a graduate seminar.
It is a great group project that combines hardware and software.
The associated python notebooks show how to analyze the data,
determine radial motions, and ultimately measure the rotation
curve of the Milky Way.
